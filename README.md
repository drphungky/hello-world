# hello-world
Hello Github, as it were.

Neophyte programmer. Damn good at SAS, but can't use that to make LEDs go blink. Still newish to proper object-oriented coding.

Currently fiddling with Python. Use a bit at work, mainly doing experiments at home for fun. May try some micropython for Arduino.

Also have some Arduino Sketch work.
